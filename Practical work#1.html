          <h1>The myth of the pier
          </h1>
              <h5>Phileas Fogg was seated squarely in his armchair, his feet close together <br>
              like those of a grenadier on parade, his hands resting on his knees, his<br>
              body straght, his head erect; he was steadily watching a complicated<br>
              clock which indicated the hours, the minutes, the seconds, the days, the<br>
              months, and the years. At exactly half-past eleven Mr.Fogg would,<br>
              according to his daily habit, quit Saville Row, and repair to the Reform.<br><br>
              A rap at this moment sounded on the door of the cosy apartment where<br>
              Phileas Fogg was seated, and James Forster, the dismissed servant,<br>
              appeared.<br><br>
              </h5>
